    Driver and any person or organization to whom charges are billed by us at its or the customer's direction. All
    persons referred to as "you" or "your" are jointly and severally bound by this Agreement. "We", "our" or "us" means
    the business named on the reverse side of this Agreement. "Authorized Driver" means the renter and any additional
    driver listed by us on this Agreement, provided that person has a valid driver's license and, is at least age 21.
    Only Authorized Drivers may operate the Vehicle. 'Vehicle" means the automobile or truck identified in this
    Agreement and any vehicle we substitute for it, and all its tires, tools, accessories, equipment, keys and vehicle
    documents. "CDW" means Collision Damage Waiver. "Physical Damage" means damage to, or loss of, the Vehicle caused by
    collision or upset; it does not include comprehensive damage or loss, such as: loss of the Vehicle due to theft;
    vandalism; act of nature; riot or civil disturbance; hail, flood; or, fire. Physical Damage excludes interior burn
    holes, window stars or cracks not caused by collision or upset. "Loss of use" means the loss of our ability to use
    the Vehicle for any purpose caused by damage or loss during this rental. Loss of use is calculated by multiplying
    the number of days from the date the Vehicle is damaged or lost until it is repaired or replaced, times the daily
    rental rate.
    2. Rental Indemnity and Warranties. This is a contract for the rental of the Vehicle. We may repossess the Vehicle
    at your expense without notice to you, if the Vehicle is abandoned or used in violation of law or this Agreement.
    You agree to indemnify us, defend us and hold us harmless from all claims, liability, costs and attorney fees we
    incur resulting from, or arising out of, this rental and your use of the Vehicle. We make no warranties, express,
    implied or apparent, regarding the vehicle, no warranty of merchantability and no warranty that the vehicle is fit
    for a particular purpose.
    3. Condition and Return of Vehicle. You must return the Vehicle to our rental office on the date and time specified
    in this Agreement, and in the same condition that you received it, except for ordinary wear. If the Vehicle is
    returned after closing hours, you remain responsible for the safety of, and any damage to, or loss of, the Vehicle
    until we inspect it upon our next opening for business. Service to the Vehicle or replacement of parts or
    accessories during the rental must have our prior approval. You must check and maintain all fluid levels.
    4. Responsibility for Damage or Loss: Reporting to Police. You are responsible for all loss or theft of, or damage
    to, the Vehicle, which includes the cost of repair, or the actual cash retail value of the Vehicle on the date of
    the loss if the Vehicle is not repairable or if we elect not to repair the vehicle, plus loss of use, diminished
    value of the Vehicle caused by damage to it or repair of it, and our administrative expenses incurred processing the
    claim. You must report all accidents or incidents of theft and vandalism to us and the police as soon as you
    discover them.
    5. Damage Waiver. If you purchase CDW, and pay for it on return of the Vehicle to us, we will waive our right to
    collect from you for a portion of Physical Damage to the Vehicle. We will not waive this right if damage to the
    Vehicle: (a) is caused by anyone who is not an Authorized Driver, or by anyone whose driving license is suspended in
    any jurisdiction; (b) is caused by anyone under the influence of prescription or non-prescription drugs or alcohol;

    from inadequately secured cargo; (p) where applicable, is caused by anyone who lacks experience operating a manual
    transmission; (q) is a result of your willful, wanton or reckless act; (r) occurs and you fail to summon the police

    Vehicle.
    6. Insurance. You are responsible for all damage or loss you cause to others. You agree to provide auto liability,
    collision and comprehensive insurance covering you, us and the Vehicle. Where state law requires us to provide auto
    liability insurance, or if you have no auto liability insurance, we provide auto liability insurance (the ·Policy")
    that is secondary to any other valid and collectible insurance whether primary, secondary, excess or contingent. The
    Policy provides bodily injury and property damage liability coverage with limits no higher than minimum levels
    prescribed by the vehicular financial responsibility laws of the state whose laws apply to the loss. You and we
    reject PIP, medical payments, no-fault and uninsured and under-insured motorist coverage, where permitted by law.
    The Policy is void if you violate the terms of this Agreement, or if you fail to cooperate in any loss investigation
    conducted by us or our insurer.

    drivers; (c) optional products and services you purchased; (d) fuel, if you return the Vehicle with less fuel than
    when rented; (e) applicable taxes; (f) all parking, traffic and toll violations, fines, penalties, forfeitures,
    court costs, towing, impound and storage charges and other expenses involving the Vehicle assessed against us or the
    vehicle, unless these expenses are our fault; (g) $50, plus $5/mile for every mile between the renting location and
    the place where the Vehicle is returned, repossessed or abandoned, plus all other expenses we incur in locating and
    recovering the Vehicle if you fail to return it or if we elect to repossess the Vehicle under the terms of this
    Agreement; (h) all costs, including pre- and post-judgment attorney fees, we incur collecting payment from you or
    otherwise enforcing our rights under this Agreement; (i) a 2% per month late payment fee, or the maximum amount
    allowed by law (if less than 2%) on all amounts past due; U) $50 or the maximum amount permitted by law, whichever
    is greater, if you pay us with a check returned unpaid for any reason; and (k) a reasonable fee not to exceed $350
    to clean the Vehicle if returned substantially less clean than when rented.
    8. Deposit. We may use your deposit to pay any amounts owed to us under this Agreement.
    9. Your Property. You release us, our agents and employees from all claims for loss of, or damage to, your personal
    property (including a vehicle) or that of any other person, that we received, handled or stored, or that was left or
    carried in or on the Vehicle or in any service vehicle or in our offices, whether or not the loss or damage was
    caused by our negligence or was otherwise our responsibility.
    10. Breach of Agreement. The acts listed in paragraph 5, above, are prohibited uses of the Vehicle and breaches of
    this Agreement. You waive all recourse against us for any criminal reports or prosecutions that we take against you
    that arise out of your breach of this Agreement.
    11. Modifications. No term of this Agreement can be waived or modified except by a writing that we have signed. If
    you wish to extend the rental period, you must return the Vehicle to our rental office for inspection and written
    amendment by us of the due-in date. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us. All prior
    representations and agreements between you and us regarding this rental are void.
    12. Miscellaneous. A waiver by us of any breach of this Agreement is not a waiver of any additional breach or waiver
    of the performance of your obligations under this Agreement. Our acceptance of payment from you or our failure,
    refusal or neglect to exercise any of our rights under this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of any other
    provision of this Agreement. Unless prohibited by law, you release us from any liability for consequential, special
    or punitive damages in connection with this rental or the reservation of a vehicle. If any provision of this
    Agreement is deemed void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions are valid and enforceable.
